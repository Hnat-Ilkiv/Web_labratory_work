## JavaScript CRUD program: backend

**Description:** In the last part of the work on the site, you must
implement all the ``create/read/update/delete'' operations that need to be performed using the appropriate HTTP methods in your REST API.
**Important!** You don't need to build a backend from scratch - plug in an existing one you've been working on in the first year.
If you don't have an internal server, you should create a new REST API using whatever technology you prefer.

**Our recommendations and advice:**
- Working with the REST API with the link fetch() (an example of the POST method)
- an example of a live coding site
