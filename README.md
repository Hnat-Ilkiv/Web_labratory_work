# 3. CRUD Javascript App: View Page
**Description:** In this work, you have to make a simple presentation part of 
a website - View Page (You can find the template of the page by following the 
link - https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/view/lviv-iot-crud-js-app
For your blocks you must use data from your java/python project class.
In case you donâ€™t have a data from previous year, you should choose any

Then using JavaScript, you need to implement the following operations on 
your data (it is up to you to decide which field should be used for each of 
the operations): 
- Sort of your items option
- Search option 
- Count total amount of some of the field (e.g total price of all cars)

**Requirements:**
- Responsiveness absolutely not required.
- Styling is not important at all. Is up to you.

**Our recommendations and tips:**
- use JS Array methods: map(), sort(), filter(), reduce()
- use native JS for any DOM operations (querySelector | findById | insertAdjacentHTML | etc)
