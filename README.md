# 2nd labrotory work from Web

**Description:** Improve a landing page following the given design (same as previous) by adding full responsiveness and some animation.

**Requirements:**
- The website should be partly responsive: Required: for 320px (iPhone 5s) 2560px (4K screens). Hint: for extra-large screen width, you can just fit website content inside a previously set container for the regular screen width and centre it horizontally.
- The header should collapse to a hamburger on small screens
- The website must contain animations (at least 3). Can be made in any possible way, preferably with css properties (animation/transition).
- Your project should be logically structured (all your CSS canâ€™t be in just one-two files)
- All of the previous work requirements must be kept.

**P.S** If your semester project has a landing website that satisfies the requirements, then you could skip this work by bringing your website for an assessment.
**Note:** The above goes only for those students, who were actually responsible for the website development. The whole team cannot use the right to skip this work!
