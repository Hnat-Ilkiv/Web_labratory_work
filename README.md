# 4. CRUD Javascript App: Create/Edit Pages
**Description:** In this work, you need to continue working and add two new
parts to your website - **Create & Edit Pages** (You can find the template of
these pages by following the link)

Update/Delete operations are not required for this work!

Also you must validate the forms using HTML attributes (inputs must be
configured for your data format).
If incorrect data is entered in the inputs, you must use JavaScript to inform
the user with **modal windows** or just plain alert() function.

**Bonus** points are provided for this work, if you implement a styled modal
window that will work with JavaScript.

## Requirements:
- **Responsiveness** absolutely not required.
- **Styling** is not important at all. Is up to you.
## Our recommendations and tips:
