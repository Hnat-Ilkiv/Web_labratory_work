# 6. React.js: Home page

**Description:** Start creating your React App with a simple Home page (see
the link to wireframe above). Your e-commerce app subject is about your
entities from previous (3-5) works.
Variants -  (products that you are ‘selling’) the same as for previous works.
(see the description to 3rd work)

**Requirements:**
- You have to use only React.js library for all of your mark-up. Which means - your index.html file shouldn’t be touched.
- Use create-react-app tool for creating base of your project https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
- Your Home page should follow the wireframe, i.e all of the elements ( header, navigation, footer etc. ) from wireframes must be presented on your website.
- Design: You have to use CSS styling or/and component libraries. Don't overthink it, use your imagination for UI, BUT the work with almost no styling is unacceptable.
- Functionality: For this work nothing but view only part is required. Any interaction (links/buttons) is not necessary, but you will have to complete them in your next labs.
- **Code style:**
    - Project structure: Your UI elements should be logically separated into React components (one file for each component) - at least 5 component files are required. In other words, you can’t just put all your JSX into 1-2 files.
    - Use Functional components instead of Class components https://uk.reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html
